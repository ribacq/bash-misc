# bash-misc
Several bash utilities and games.

## 9blanc
A game consisting of 12 tiles being black or white, set in a 3×4 board. By pressing a tile using the corresponding key, it’s and its neighbors’ colors are inverted. The game is won by setting every tile to white.

## aquarium
This is about politeness. `"$(aquarium -s)"` should ideally be included in your bash `PS1` variable. Aquarium displays a single smiley face which goes sad after a delay, unless you tell it `aquarium`, using this single command.

## jics
A snake game. The controls are simple: `t` to turn to your left, `n` to turn to your right.

## li
A simple list management tool. Try `li --help` for more information on usage.
